# Recipe Manager -- Telegram bot

Project for practicing in Python, MongoDB, Telegram API, ML, Text and Audio recognition.

ATM Recipe Manager can handle this basic functionality:
1. Add new recipe to database
2. View your previously added recipes by category
3. Search within your recipes pull and all other users recipes, marked as searchable
4. Like recipe of another user
